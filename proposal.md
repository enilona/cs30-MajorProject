# Major Project Proposal

## Project Description

For my project I am going to be making a weather predictor that uses past data to predict the weather for the future. The goal is to incorporate data reading features and figure out an algorithm to predict the weather.

## Need to Have List

- Takes in data from past weather reports
- Displays the max and min temperature
- weather prediction is organized 
- uses an algorithm to analyze data
- predicts weather for Saskatoon

## Nice to Have List

- The program incorporates some randomness to the weather prediction 
- The final website looks nice 
- Weather report is shown in multiple locations (other cities, countries etc)
- predicts other weather (not just temperature)

- Can predict furthur into the future (for example 10 days ahead)??
- takes into account climate change??
