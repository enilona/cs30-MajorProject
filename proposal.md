# Major Project Proposal

## Project Description

For my project I am going to be making a weather predictor that uses past data to predict the weather for the future. 

## Need to Have List

- Takes in data from past weather reports
- Displays the predicted weather for that day in Saskatoon
- weather prediction is organized 

## Nice to Have List

- The program incorporates some randomness to the weather prediction 
- The final website looks nice 
- Multiple locations can be chosen to show the weather
- Can predict furthur into the future (10 days ahead type setup)
