# Beta Testing

## My mom
Overall my mom liked the way that the weather display looked and she didn't have much to say other than to make the decimal places more consistent. She said that I could make the display a little bigger so that it is a little easier to read the things on the screen. Together we also had an idea that it would be cool if a person could flip through the days by using the arrow keys. This is something that I had thought about before and if I have time I may try to code it in (depending on how difficult it is). We also discussed that it may be useful if the user is given a little message on when the data is available (because right now my code can't go furthur back then 1980).

## My brother
My brother didn't have too much to say about the way that my program worked, although he did make a few suggestions that I may implement if I have time.
One of the suggestions was to make the date selection box bigger of more easy to see. He also made a few suggestions on the way that the data was displayed such as getting rid of the mm or km/h after the data if I already have it written. 
He also suggested that I display a differnt weather icon depending on the weather data for that day.
