# Beta Testing

## My mom
Overall my mom liked the way that the weather display looked and she didn't have much to say other than to make the decimal places more consistent. She said that I could make the display a little bigger so that it is a little easier to read the things on the screen. Together we also had an idea that it would be cool if a person could flip through the days by using the arrow keys. This is something that I had thought about before and if I have time I may try to code it in (depending on how difficult it is). We also discussed that it may be useful if the user is given a little message on when the data is available (because right now my code can't go furthur back then 1980).
