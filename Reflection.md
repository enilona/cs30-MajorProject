# Project Reflection

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
If I were to have a chance to redo the cs30 course and do this major project I would probably not choose this topic. Though I really like the idea, I think that it would have been nice if I could have made this project more visual but because it took so much time to get everything else working I never had time to make it look the way I wanted to. Another idea that I had along the way that is similar to the project that I did was to create a visual of a specific game, including the sun rising and setting, some trees, wind ect. 
If I were to redo this project and I had to stay with the same topic I would probably try to just focus on a few days of data, but getting the wntire days weather (gov.can has hourly weather data as well) and display how the weather changes throughout the day. 
Another idea that I just had that I think I would have enjoyed a lot more would have been to display the differnet months and seasons in a year. This would have been super cool to have a visual representation of seasons changing. I could make smaller animations for how the leaves fall off the trees, how snow falls, how plants grow etc.


## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
In the end, completing everything in my needs to have list turned out to be the easiest part of my project.

## What was the hardest part of the project?

## What did you learn?
